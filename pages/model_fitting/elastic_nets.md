## What is elastic net regression?

Elastic net regression is a method of regularization for fitting linear and logistic models using a combination of ridge and lasso methods to penalize the models. Regularization complements machine learning models that may have large numbers of predictors or correlated predictors which result in more variance in the model. By penalizing the model, elastic net introduces some bias which can make the model more generalizable to new data (i.e., lower variance) and reduce overfitting. Ridge regression penalizes the sum of squared coefficients  (L2) and lasso regression penalizes the sum of absolute values of the coefficients (L1). Elastic net combines these two types of penalties to find a good variance-bias tradeoff for the model. The optimal size of the penalty for a model can be determined via tuning parameters with cross-validation.

**Types of regularization**   

* Ridge regression: variables with minor contribution have their coefficients close to zero. However, all the variables are incorporated in the model. This is useful when all variables need to be incorporated in the model according to domain knowledge.

* Lasso regression: the coefficients of some less contributive variables are forced to be exactly zero. Only the most significant variables are kept in the final model.   
Regularization Part 2: Lasso Regression

* Elastic net regression: the combination of ridge and lasso regression. It shrinks some coefficients toward zero (like ridge regression) and set some coefficients to exactly zero (like lasso regression).
