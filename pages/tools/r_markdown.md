## Framing

R Markdown builds off tools already available in R and RStudio to provide an integrated environment for processing, coding, and communicating. An R Markdown file can include text, chunks of code, images, links, figures, and tables. While you’re working in your RStudio environment, your file operates similarly to a normal R script (a .R file) - you can write, edit, and evaluate code to work with your data. At any point, you can “knit” your file. Knitting runs, evaluates, and compiles your R Markdown file into your desired output (e.g., HTML, PDF) to create a single document that includes all the components of your written file plus the results. This knit file is ready for high-quality scientific communication with any audience. If you’ve ever seen nice examples of R code and output online, it was probably made using R Markdown.


## Why should I use R Markdown? 

You should use R Markdown if…
* You already work in R or RStudio and would like some additional tools at your disposal
* You value reproducible output
* You would like to be able to share your work with people who are less familiar with R (or coding more generally)
* R Markdown combines the data wrangling and analytic tools of R with high-class scientific communication. It can become your one-stop-shop for sharing your data science.
